## 🚀 Decision Matrix

### Choose Docker Compose if:
- [ ] You're new to Docker
- [ ] Development or testing environment
- [ ] Single server deployment
- [ ] Want quick setup
- [ ] Learning Supabase

### Choose Docker Swarm if:
- [ ] Production deployment
- [ ] Multi-server environment
- [ ] High availability required
- [ ] Team collaboration
- [ ] Need automatic scaling

### Choose Portainer if:
- [ ] You prefer GUI management
- [ ] Team collaboration needed
- [ ] Visual monitoring preferred
- [ ] Managing multiple projects
- [ ] Non-technical team members

## 📈 Migration Path

### Development → Production

```
Docker Compose → Docker Swarm
     ↓              ↓
   Testing      Production
```

### Adding GUI Management

```
Docker Swarm → Portainer
     ↓            ↓
   CLI Only    GUI + CLI
```

## 🔧 Setup Complexity

### Docker Compose
1. Copy environment template
2. Edit `.env` file
3. Run `docker-compose -f docker-compose.standalone.yml up -d`

### Docker Swarm
1. Initialize swarm
2. Run setup script: `./setup.sh --swarm`
3. Edit `.env` file
4. Deploy: `docker stack deploy -c docker-compose.yml supabase`

### Portainer
1. Install Portainer
2. Create external resources (GUI or script)
3. Edit `.env` file
4. Deploy stack in Portainer GUI

## 💡 Recommendations

### For Beginners
**Start with Docker Compose** - It's the easiest way to get Supabase running and learn how it works.

### For Development Teams
**Use Docker Compose** for local development, then **Docker Swarm** for staging/production.

### For Operations Teams
**Use Docker Swarm** for production deployments with **Portainer** for management.

### For Small Teams
**Use Portainer** - Provides the best balance of ease-of-use and production capabilities.

## 🆘 Still Not Sure?
